# Green Hell Trainer

Green Hell is a lesson taught by rain, fever, and silence.
The jungle doesn’t rush you — it *waits*.
For hunger. For infection. For one careless step.

**Green Hell Trainer** doesn’t silence that lesson.
It lets you *choose how hard it speaks*.

## 🌿 Overview

Green Hell Trainer is a **real-time survival adjustment tool** built for players who want control over intensity, pacing, and experimentation. It connects to the running game and allows live toggles — no restarts, no permanent save edits, no broken immersion.

Some days you want brutal realism.
Other days, you want to explore, learn, and breathe.

The jungle allows both.

## 🌘 Final Thoughts

Green Hell is not about winning.
It’s about *enduring* — and understanding why you failed.

This Trainer doesn’t erase the jungle.
It gives you space to listen longer.

Walk deeper.
Learn slower.
And let survival become a dialogue, not a punishment.
